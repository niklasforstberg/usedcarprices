This script automates the process of finding out what a fair price for a given car might be. It is based on the swedish used car market. So as to not swamp the website with requests, the script is run in a loop with a delay between each request. Be nice to the website and the server.

## Usage

Run the script from the command line:
main.py --make 'Ariel' --model 'Atom'
